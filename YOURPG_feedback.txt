Counter did not reset after midnight. Perhaps give user a setting for counter reset time. 
calandar only shows the current day, doesn't actually progress streak.

I found that I use the app like this: Something I know is good for me but I often don't do - in my case take supplements, brush teeth after meal, study Japanese on anki. I then realize oh! how much exp would this be worth? Then I brush my teeth and give exp.

I found that tasks I have been putting off, I ask myself what if this task is worth 200 exp? Then do the task.
could add to notifications 'What task have you been putting off? How much exp is it worth?"
